<div align="center"><h2><b>NEWB30</b></h2>DO NOT SHARE

You are cordially invited to my 30th birthday in Rome, Italy during the last weekend in April. Fuck, I can’t believe I’m actually planning this day but here we are.</div>
My parents have <b>*very*</b> graciously taken care of accommodations in Rome for three nights (four days) 4/27-4/30. You just need to cover your transportation. As you can imagine, this will be a party and pasta-heavy trip. (And yes, Bruce and Nancy will be staying close by celebrating with us as well)

Please RSVP by Dec 20th by sending me a copy of your booked flight itinerary. I understand this red sauce involves a great expense in the form of time and $$ so there’s absolutely zero pressure if you cannot attend for any reason whatsoever. If you are slightly unsure/on the fence I would be much happier if you opt out now vs. change your RSVP later since there are a lot of logistics involved. There will be other celebrations. 

Please do not discuss this trip with anyone outside of the people on this list. There are only so many friends I can invite for this one so I really don’t want to hurt any feelings. 

That’s all for now. Hit me with any questions.

Ciao,
Matteo
